**Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm**
=====================================

**What is BFS?**
----------------

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph or a tree level by level, starting from a given source node. It is a popular algorithm used to search for a path between two nodes in an unweighted graph or a tree.

**How BFS Works**
-----------------

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:

1. **Choose a starting node**: Select a node in the graph as the starting point for the search.
2. **Create a queue**: Create a queue data structure to hold the nodes to be visited.
3. **Enqueue the starting node**: Add the starting node to the queue.
4. **Mark the starting node as visited**: Mark the starting node as visited to avoid revisiting it.
5. **Dequeue a node**: Remove a node from the queue and visit it.
6. **Explore the node's neighbors**: Explore the neighbors of the dequeued node and add them to the queue if they have not been visited before.
7. **Mark the node's neighbors as visited**: Mark the node's neighbors as visited to avoid revisiting them.
8. **Repeat steps 5-7**: Repeat steps 5-7 until the queue is empty.
9. **Return the result**: Return the order of visited nodes or the path from the starting node to the target node.

**Key Concepts**
----------------

* **Queue**: A queue data structure is used to hold the nodes to be visited.
* **Visited nodes**: A set or a boolean array is used to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.
* **Level**: BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the starting node.
* **Neighbor**: A neighbor of a node is a node that is directly connected to it.

**Time and Space Complexity**
-----------------------------

* **Time complexity**: O(|E| + |V|), where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices.
* **Space complexity**: O(|V|), where |V| is the number of vertices.

**Applications**
--------------

* **Shortest path**: BFS can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
* **Graph traversal**: BFS can be used to traverse a graph or a tree level by level.
* **Network topology discovery**: BFS can be used to discover the topology of a network.

**Implementation**
-----------------

The implementation of BFS can be found in the `Breadth-first-search.py` file in this repository. The implementation uses a queue data structure to hold the nodes to be visited and a set to keep track of visited nodes.
