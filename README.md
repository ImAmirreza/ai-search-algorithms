# AI Search Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the AI Search Algorithms Repository

This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence (AI), covering both uninformed and informed search techniques.

## What's Inside

### Uninformed Search Algorithms

* **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
* **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
* **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**

### Informed Search Algorithms

* **Greedy Search**
* **A\* Search**
* **IDA\* Search**
* **Best-First Search**
